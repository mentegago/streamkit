**This app is still in very early stage. There will be a lot of bugs.**

## Features
- Multilingual Twitch Text-to-Speech (Based on [Mentega TTS](https://github.com/mentegago/mentega-tts))

## Coming Soon
- Beat Saber to OBS scene control (Based on [Mentega Beat Saber to OBS](https://github.com/mentegago/mentega-bs2obs))

## Building
This app is written with [Flutter on Desktop](https://flutter.dev/multi-platform/desktop). You'll need **Flutter** SDK to be installed as well as everything [required to build a Flutter Windows app](https://docs.flutter.dev/desktop#additional-windows-requirements). 

This app has not been tested to run on macOS or Linux, however, the libraries used in this project are all crossplatform, so I don't think there should be any issue building for oher platforms.
