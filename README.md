**This app is still in early stage.**

StreamKit Chat Reader is a free Twitch chat reader (text-to-speech) app that supports Indonesian, English, and Japanese simultaneously. StreamKit is designed for my streaming use cases ([https://twitch.tv/mentegagoreng](https://twitch.tv/mentegagoreng)), therefore some of the features will be tailored towards my needs, such as Beat Saber specific reading.

Feel free to suggest feature or report bug at the [Issues](https://github.com/mentegago/streamkit/issues) page or if you're a developer too and want to improve StreamKit, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/mentegago/streamkit/pulls).

## Usage
Download the latest version at [the release page](https://github.com/mentegago/streamkit/releases/latest). Download the zip file (**be aware to download "StreamKit" archive, not the "Source Code" archive!**), extract, and run `streamkit_tts.exe`. Follow the instruction in the app.

## Building
This app is written with [Flutter on Desktop](https://flutter.dev/multi-platform/desktop). You'll need **Flutter** SDK to be installed as well as everything [required to build a Flutter Windows app](https://docs.flutter.dev/desktop#additional-windows-requirements). 

This app has not been tested to run on macOS or Linux, however, the libraries used in this project are all crossplatform, so I don't think there should be any issue building for other platforms.
